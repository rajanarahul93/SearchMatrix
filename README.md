# SearchMatrix - Word Search Algorithm Visualizer

**SearchMatrix** is a web-based visualizer that demonstrates how different algorithms solve word search puzzles in a grid. The supported algorithms include:
- **Brute Force**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**

This tool is designed for students, educators, and developers to explore and understand how these algorithms work by visualizing the step-by-step process.

## Features

- Customizable grid dimensions (rows and columns)
- Set your own starting position and target word
- Choose from three different solving algorithms
- Control marker and answer colors
- Adjustable animation speed to observe each step of the solving process
- View elapsed time for each algorithm's execution
- Real-time grid generation with interactive visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajanarahul93/SearchMatrix.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

## Usage

1. Customize the grid by setting:
   - **Row Number**: Number of rows in the grid (3-10)
   - **Col Number**: Number of columns in the grid (3-26)
   - **Starting Number**: The starting point number
   - **Target Words**: Enter the word(s) you want to search for in the grid

2. Click **Generate** to create the word search grid.

3. Customize the animation settings:
   - **Marker Color**: The color used for marking grid cells during the search
   - **Answer Color**: The color used to highlight the final solution
   - **Interval Time**: Set the delay between steps (in milliseconds)

4. Choose a solving algorithm by clicking the respective button:
   - **Brute Force**
   - **Dynamic Programming**
   - **Backtracking**

5. The algorithm will run, and you can observe the step-by-step process in the grid.

6. The **Elapsed Time** shows how long the algorithm took to solve the puzzle.

## Demo

To see a demo, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser and interact with the grid generator and algorithms.
